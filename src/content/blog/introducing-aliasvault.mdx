# Introducing AliasVault

Today marks an important milestone in my journey to help people protect their online privacy. After years of running [SpamOK.com](https://spamok.com), a free temporary email service that has helped thousands of users since 2013, I'm excited to introduce AliasVault - a new evolution in privacy protection. The first commit has just been made to [GitHub](https://github.com/aliasvault/aliasvault), marking the official start of this project.

## The Evolution of Privacy Protection

SpamOK.com was born from a simple idea: give people a way to protect their real email addresses from spam and unwanted tracking. Over the years, I noticed a growing need for more comprehensive privacy solutions. Users wanted not just temporary email addresses, but a way to manage their online identities securely and permanently.

This realization led to the creation of AliasVault, which combines two essential privacy tools:
- Secure, end-to-end encrypted password management
- Convenient email alias management

## Why AliasVault?

In today's digital world, our online identities are constantly at risk. Companies track us across websites, data breaches expose our personal information, and spam floods our inboxes. AliasVault addresses these challenges by providing:

- Unique email aliases for every service
- End-to-end encrypted password management
- Complete control over your online identity
- Self-hostable solution for maximum privacy
- Open-source codebase for complete transparency

I believe that when people entrust their most sensitive credentials to a platform, they should be able to see exactly what it's doing with their data. That's why AliasVault is and will always remain open-source, allowing anyone to review the code, verify its security, and even contribute to its development. This transparency is fundamental to building trust in a privacy-focused platform.

## The Road Ahead

This is just the beginning. AliasVault will continue to evolve, with plans for browser extensions, mobile apps, and more features to make privacy protection even more accessible. My vision is to create a comprehensive privacy toolkit that puts users in complete control of their online presence.

I invite you to join me on this journey to make online privacy more accessible to everyone. Whether you're a privacy enthusiast or just starting to protect your online identity, AliasVault is here to help.

Stay tuned for more updates, and feel free to reach out with your thoughts and feedback!
