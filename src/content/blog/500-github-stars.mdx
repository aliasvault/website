# 500 GitHub Stars: A Milestone in Privacy Protection

We're thrilled to announce that AliasVault has reached 500 GitHub stars in just 4 months! This incredible milestone is made even more impressive by the fact that we've seen over 2,000 downloads of our Docker containers, representing a significant number of self-hosted installations of AliasVault.

## The Power of Community

When we launched AliasVault, we knew there was a need for better privacy tools, but the overwhelming response has been truly humbling. The rapid growth of our GitHub repository shows that people are not just interested in privacy - they're actively seeking solutions they can trust and control.

What makes this milestone even more special is that many of these stars represent actual self-hosted installations of AliasVault. This means hundreds of individuals and organizations are now taking control of their online privacy by running their own instances of our platform.

## Join Our Growing Community

The best part? This is just the beginning. We're building something special here, and we want you to be part of it. Our community is growing every day, and we're constantly working on new features and improvements.

## Looking Ahead

This milestone is not just about celebrating what we've achieved, but about looking forward to what we can accomplish together. With your support, we'll continue to:
- Enhance our privacy protection features
- Improve the self-hosting experience
- Build a stronger community of privacy advocates
- Make online privacy accessible to everyone

Thank you to everyone who has supported us so far. Your trust and enthusiasm drive us to keep pushing forward. Here's to the next 500 stars and beyond!
