One year ago, on May 31, 2024, the very first public commit to AliasVault was made [on GitHub](https://github.com/lanedirt/AliasVault/commit/0a3d35c603218d6a2dc030018a1e84e7030946b8). What started as a simple prototype for a privacy-first alias and credential manager has grown into a full-featured, cross-platform tool that helps users take back control of their digital identities.

## Highlights from the first year

Everything that AliasVault is today, has been created from the ground-up in the last 12 months. Some of the milestones we’re especially proud of:

- Public web app launch with fully end-to-end encrypted vault model
- Security features including 2FA support in the core
- Browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari for autofill and alias generation on the fly
- Native iOS and Android apps
- Active open source development

## 📊 Numbers so far

This time last year, AliasVault was just an idea. I'm very proud that to today, it has grown to:

- 📦 18 official releases (2,200 commits and counting)
- ☁️ 2,300+ cloud users
- 💾 5,700+ self-hosted downloads
- ⭐️ 900+ GitHub stars

## 🚀 Major milestones

- In **December 2024**, after 7 months of quiet development, the first **public beta release** went live and was posted on Reddit, Hacker News, and other platforms. You can read the first Reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1hci4jx/i_built_an_opensource_password_and_alias_manager/).
- GitHub stars started growing steadily from that moment on, as visible in this chart:

- We received a lot of positive feedback on the concept of AliasVault.
- In 2025, so far we've delivered major updates: **browser extensions**, **iOS app**, **Android app**, and numerous **platform improvements**.
- I’ve personally spent approximately **1,500 hours** on AliasVault to reach this point.

## The next year

It's my personal goal for 2025 to release **v1.0 before the end of the year**. The full roadmap with all the things planned for v1.0 can be found here on GitHub: [AliasVault v1.0 Roadmap](https://github.com/lanedirt/AliasVault/issues/731)

You can expect more security related features, easier management, improved datamodel and UI, performance improvements, and other general platform maturity improvement updates in the coming months.

Thanks to all early adopters for using AliasVault and sharing their feedback. Here's to the next year of AliasVault!
