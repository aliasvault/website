I'm happy to share that **AliasVault has just crossed 1,000 GitHub stars**. It‚Äôs amazing to see that AliasVault is being used by more and more people every day, and more people in the open-source community are finding out about it.

## Momentum is Building

Since the 500 GitHub stars milestone in March, the momentum has only increased. In addition to more stars and downloads, we‚Äôve seen:

- More people joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/DsaXMTEtpF) to share ideas and help each other
- Continuous feedback from both self-hosters and cloud users, helping us improve every release

The chart below shows the growth in interest in the last couple of months:

## Trusted by the Community

What makes this milestone meaningful is not just the number of stars, it's what they represent. Many of these stars come from developers and privacy advocates who are **self-hosting** AliasVault and actively using it, testing new features and reporting bugs.

We‚Äôre proud that the project is being recognized as a serious tool for taking control of your digital identity. From browser extensions to native mobile apps, AliasVault is evolving fast, and it‚Äôs all open source.
