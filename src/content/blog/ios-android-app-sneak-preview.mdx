## What to Expect

The mobile apps will bring the full power of AliasVault to your smartphone, with features including:

- Easy access to all your AliasVault credentials on the go
- Native autofill integration for both iOS and Android
- Quick creation of new email aliases directly from your phone
- Secure access to your encrypted alias emails
- Biometric authentication (Face ID / Touch ID) for vault access, with encryption keys securely stored in the device's native keychain

## Release Timeline

We're planning to release the iOS version first, which we expect to be ready in about 2 weeks from now (mid May). The Android version will follow approximately 2-3 weeks later.

## A Major Milestone

The launch of these mobile apps will mark a significant milestone for AliasVault, making it available across all major platforms:
- ✅ Web application (accessible from anywhere)
- ✅ Browser extensions for autofill on all major desktop browsers (on all operating systems)
- ⏳ Native iOS and Android apps

This comprehensive platform coverage ensures that you can access your privacy tools wherever you are, whether you're at your desk or on the move.

## Looking Ahead

Once the mobile apps are launched, we'll continue to improve and enhance them based on user feedback. Our next focus will be on making AliasVault even more user-friendly by:
- Introducing support for folders
- Adding more flexibility in credential field management
- Implementing identity reuse features
- And more exciting improvements

Stay tuned for more updates as we get closer to the app store releases! We can't wait to bring AliasVault's privacy protection to your mobile devices.
