Hello AliasVault users and supporters!

I'm happy to share with you the latest updates in the AliasVault development roadmap. A lot of work is being done on a **major datamodel update** that will bring significant improvements. This is one of the largest refactors that has been undertaken so far, focusing on making the data model more robust and flexible, while also introducing powerful new features.

## What's Coming

This update has already been in development for some time and will probably be released **somewhere at the end of January**. While many changes are backend-related (which means some improvements might not be immediately obvious), this update lays a crucial foundation that will enable us to add new features more easily in future releases.

### New Features

- **Full offline mode**: Complete offline functionality for browser extension and mobile apps, including local offline editing with auto-merge on next sync
- **New item types**: Credit card and secure note items, with more coming in next releases
- **Custom field support**: Add custom fields to any item
- **Field history**: View and restore previous versions of fields (e.g., passwords)
- **Recently deleted items**: Restore accidentally deleted items
- **Folder support**: Organize credentials with folders

These improvements align with the [AliasVault v1.0 roadmap](https://github.com/aliasvault/aliasvault/issues/731), which outlines our path toward the stable 1.0 release. This update implements many of the datamodel tweaks published in the roadmap.

## Happy Holidays!
As we're already on December 23rd, we'd like to wish all AliasVault users **happy holidays and a happy new year**! We're grateful for your continued support, feedback, and trust in AliasVault.

This update will be **worth the wait** and will significantly enhance your AliasVault experience. Stay tuned for more updates as we get closer to the release.
