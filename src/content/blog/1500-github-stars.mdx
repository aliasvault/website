## What's Coming: Passkey Support

We're excited to share that **Passkey support is coming to AliasVault**! This is a major step forward in making digital identity management even more secure and user-friendly.

### Current Progress

In our development branch, the browser extension has already implemented the base WebAuthn specification, which means:

- **Create Passkeys**: Generate secure passkeys directly in your browser
- **Secure Storage**: Store passkeys safely in your vault with end-to-end encryption
- **Seamless Login**: Use your passkeys to authenticate across supported services

### Timeline

In the next weeks we'll be continuing work focusing on:

- **Browser extension finalization**: Completing the remaining Passkey browser extension features
- **Mobile app integration**: Adding Passkey support to mobile applications
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Ensuring seamless experience across all devices

This represents a significant leap forward in passwordless authentication, making AliasVault even more powerful for managing your digital identity securely.
