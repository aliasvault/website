I'm happy to share that the latest release of AliasVault, 0.26.0 is out now.

This is one of the biggest releases yet with a **major architecture upgrade** that unlocks long-requested features like **custom fields**, **folders**, **new item types**, **history tracking**, **recently deleted items**, and **true offline vault access and editing** with automatic vault merging.

Alongside these major additions, this release includes security improvements, performance optimizations, and many community-requested fixes.

> 🚨 **Important Note:** This release includes a client vault model update. After upgrading, your vault can only be opened by v0.26.0+ app versions. For self-hosted users: make sure you update your server to avoid compatibility issues.

## 🏗️ 1. New Vault Architecture

We listened to all your feedback in the last months and designed a new architecture to support all of these ideas. Thanks to this major architecture upgrade, AliasVault now supports the following powerful new features:

### New Item Types
AliasVault now supports **credit card** and **secure note** item types.

### Folder Support
You can now **group your credentials** using folders, making it easier to organize and find your items.

### Custom Fields
Store exactly what you need with **custom fields** and easy copy/paste.

### Field History Tracking
**See previous values** for usernames and passwords. Track when and how your credentials changed over time.

### Recently Deleted Items
Deleted items are now kept in a **recently deleted** list with the **option to restore** them, so you can recover accidentally removed credentials.

## 📴 2. Full Offline Mode

You now have **full access to your vault even without a server connection**, in both the browser extension and mobile apps.

### Key Benefits:
- **View and edit your vault completely offline**, no internet required
- **Changes sync automatically** once you're back online
- **Built-in conflict merging** across all apps and devices
- **Field-level merge logic**, e.g. username changed on device A, password on device B → both are preserved
- **Last-write-wins per field** when conflicts occur

This makes AliasVault truly usable on the go, in areas with poor connectivity, or when you simply prefer to work offline.

## 🌍 3. New Language Options

AliasVault is now also available in **Romanian**, which means AliasVault is now available in a total of **14 languages**! A big thank you to all of our translators who continue to work hard adding translations for all the new and reworked features. Do you want to improve translations and/or make AliasVault available in your native language? Check out the AliasVault project on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/aliasvault/) and contribute.

In addition, we added **Italian** as a language option to the built-in identity generator. Do you want to help make your language available to the identity generator for the alias feature? Check out [this guide](https://docs.aliasvault.net/contributing/identity-generator.html).

## 🚀 4. General Improvements

### New Rust Core Library
We introduced a new **cross-platform core library written in Rust**, improving:
- Sync merging reliability
- Autofill matching accuracy
- Shared logic consistency across all clients

### Passkey Wizard
When creating a new passkey, the wizard will now **suggest existing credentials** to save the passkey into, instead of creating a second duplicate entry.

### NordPass Importer
A new **NordPass import method** has been added, making it easier to migrate from NordPass to AliasVault.

### Updated Importers
All existing importers have been updated to also import **credit cards** and **secure notes** separately, plus **folders** (if there are any).

## 🐞 5. Bug Fixes

- **Large vaults**: Fixed issues where large vaults could throw errors when trying to open them in the browser extension
- **Favicon deduplication**: Favicon logos are now deduplicated, duplicate credentials for the same website now share the same favicon, resulting in a **smaller vault size**
- **Self-hosted admin**: Fixed bug where changing username in the self-hosted admin panel could result in login issues

## 🔄 6. Upgrade Instructions

This release includes a **client vault model update**. After upgrading, your vault can only be opened by v0.26.0+ app versions.

### For Self-Hosted Users:

**Important:** Make sure you update your server before updating clients to avoid compatibility issues.
