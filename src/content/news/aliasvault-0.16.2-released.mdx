## New Import Support

We've added support for importing credentials from **Dashlane** into AliasVault via the import wizard. This makes it easier than ever to migrate your password data securely.

## UI Improvements

Subtle but important updates to the interface include:

- Shorter date format in the credentials page emails component
- Improved consistency and layout polish across the UI

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where changing a password twice without reloading the page would result in an error

## Dependency Updates

Third-party components have been updated to the latest stable versions.
