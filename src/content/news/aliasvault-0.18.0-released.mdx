## 🤖 Native Android App Now Available

AliasVault’s native **Android app** has arrived on Google Play. It brings mobile-first security and usability, including:

- Native autofill support for apps and websites
- Biometric unlock (Fingerprint, Face)
- Seamless integration with both self-hosted and cloud-hosted setups

[Download AliasVault for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.aliasvault.app)

With this addition, you can now access AliasVault wherever you are, on **web, iOS, Android, and browser extensions** — with a consistent, secure experience.

## 🔐 Admin Control: Revoke All Sessions

Admins can now instantly **revoke all active sessions** for a user with a single click. This is especially useful for emergency deactivations or incident response.

## 📩 More Admin Visibility

The user list in the admin panel now shows how many emails each user has received — adding a new layer of visibility for usage monitoring.

## 🧠 Browser Extension Autofill Accuracy

We’ve fixed some long-standing issues in the browser extension:

- Prevented autofill from triggering on irrelevant (non-login) fields
- Fixed crashes when entering self-hosted URLs without an HTTPS prefix

The result is a more precise and stable autofill experience across websites.

## 🛠️ Other Fixes and Changes

- Fixed Docker volume path issue with self-hosted setups trying to enable SSL certs
- Resolved username/email overflow in the UI
- Closed an API issue that could expose whether a username exists
- Removed legacy SQLite server dependencies
