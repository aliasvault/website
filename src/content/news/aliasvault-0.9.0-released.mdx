# Public Beta Now Available

We’re excited to announce that **AliasVault is now available as a public beta**! After months of development, AliasVault now contains all feature sets that make it possible to fully [self-host AliasVault](https://github.com/lanedirt/AliasVault) on your own server using the simple provided installer file.

# What is AliasVault?
AliasVault is an end-to-end encrypted password and alias manager designed to keep your identity and personal data private. It generates unique usernames, email aliases, and strong passwords for every service you use—making it much harder for your real identity to be tracked, leaked, or compromised.

With AliasVault, you can:
- Store passwords securely with end-to-end encryption
- Create and manage email aliases to shield your real address
- Manage logins and identities across all your accounts
- Run everything on your own infrastructure for maximum control

# Why This Release Matters
This 0.9.0 release marks the first public beta, meaning AliasVault is now ready for broader testing and real-world use. You can self-host it with minimal setup using our install.sh script, which automates everything from pulling Docker images to generating environment files.

We’ve also introduced key infrastructure improvements to make hosting and managing AliasVault easier, including:
- A stats dashboard for system monitoring
- Improved logging and background cleanup
- Streamlined deployment and update process

# Get Started Now
AliasVault is 100% open-source and ready for you to try. Head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/lanedirt/AliasVault/releases/tag/0.9.0) for full release notes, or just jump right into the install script.
