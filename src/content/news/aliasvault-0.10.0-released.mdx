# PostgreSQL Migration and Enhanced Features

We're excited to announce the release of AliasVault 0.10.0, introducing PostgreSQL support and various new features for improved performance and security.
Previous versions of the AliasVault server used SQLite for the server database which was not built for high-concurrency environments. This version fixes this by
switching the server database to PostgreSQL.

Enhanced protection and control:

- Username sanity checks to prevent vault corruption
- Option to disable new user registration
- User blocking capability in admin interface
- Configurable refresh token lifetime

## User Interface Improvements

- Dark mode text readability improvements
- Auto-submit login form with 2FA code
- Better loading indicators
- Improved admin interface

## Technical Improvements

Under the hood improvements include:

- Database import/export commands
- Enhanced error logging
