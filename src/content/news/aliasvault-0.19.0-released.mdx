# Full Vault Mutation in Browser Extension and Security Enhancements

With AliasVault 0.19.0, the browser extension has received a major update: you can now manage your credentials directly from the extension and create, edit and delete entries without needing to login to the web app. We‚Äôve also rolled out a series of **platform-wide polish improvements** and **security hardening updates** for self-hosted users.

## üß© Browser Extension: Full Vault Mutation

As requested by a lot of our users: the browser extension now supports **creating, updating, and deleting credentials** straight from within the browser extension, so you don't have to switch to the web app anymore for basic vault tasks.

This update brings the extension in line with the mobile apps (iOS & Android). It's now easier to use than ever.

## ‚ú® Platform-Wide Quality-of-Life Improvements

We‚Äôve added several small, thoughtful changes that improve your overall AliasVault experience:

- **Mobile:** Long-press actions on credential cards for quick access, repositioned credential create buttons for better reachability
- **Web App:** New loading animations for smoother navigation
- **UI Tweaks:** Updated app icons with better contrast
- **Browser Extension:** Improved popups, dialogs, and resize behavior for more flexibility

Together, these updates bring a more polished and consistent feel across all platforms.

## üîí Self-Hosted Security Improvements

For those self-hosting AliasVault, we‚Äôve added **new HTTP security headers** to our default `nginx` reverse proxy Docker image. These headers help harden your deployment **out of the box** and align with best practices for modern web security.

If you're self-hosting, we strongly recommend updating your AliasVault instance and taking advantage of the improved defaults. To update a self-hosted AliasVault instance, please follow the [Updating AliasVault](https://docs.aliasvault.net/installation/update/) instructions on the docs website.

## üêû Notable Fixes

- Fixed cache clearing issues in the web app after vault reloads
- Resolved broken email attachment downloads in both the mobile app and browser extension
- Corrected browser extension version display in the settings screen

## üõ£Ô∏è What‚Äôs Next?

As we move toward v1.0, expect continued improvements in **credential management flows**, **alias handling**, and **self-hosted usability**.
