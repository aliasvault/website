## 🔐 1. Passkey Support (WebAuthn Level 2)

AliasVault now supports creating and logging in with **passkeys** on websites and apps. This long-awaited feature brings passwordless authentication to your encrypted vault.

### Key Features:
- **Cross-platform support**: Passkeys work via the AliasVault browser extension, iOS app, and Android app
- **Secure storage**: Passkeys are safely stored in your encrypted vault and automatically synced across all your devices
- **WebAuthn Level 2 compliance**: Full support for the latest WebAuthn standards

Passkeys provide a more secure and convenient alternative to traditional passwords, using cryptographic keys stored on your devices. If you come across any bugs or issues when using passkeys, please reach out to us on Discord or create an issue on GitHub.

## 🌍 2. New Language Options

AliasVault is now available in **three additional languages**, bringing secure password management to even more users around the world:

- **Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR)**
- **Russian (ru)**
- **Polish (pl)**
