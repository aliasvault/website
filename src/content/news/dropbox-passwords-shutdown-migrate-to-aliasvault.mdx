Dropbox recently announced the shutdown of its password manager, Dropbox Passwords, meaning users will need to export and migrate their saved credentials to another secure solution. This change affects more than a hundred thousand users who have trusted Dropbox to store their login information.

At AliasVault, we've built an easy migration process that imports your Dropbox Passwords data directly into your vault with no manual retyping and no complicated formatting. Our latest release (0.22.0) includes a dedicated Dropbox Passwords importer to make this transition seamless.

## ðŸš¨ Why Dropbox Passwords is Shutting Down

Dropbox has made the difficult decision to discontinue their password manager service. While the exact reasons haven't been fully disclosed, this is part of a broader trend where companies are focusing on their core services. Users have until **October 28, 2025** to export their data before the service is permanently discontinued.

This shutdown reflects a growing industry realization: **all-in-one platforms often compromise on security and privacy**. Many software companies that previously offered password management as an "add-on" feature are now advising users to migrate to dedicated, specialized password managers instead.
