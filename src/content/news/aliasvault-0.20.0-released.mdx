## üìß Optimized Email Experience

The email functionality has received an upgrade focused on usability and real-time updates. The web app now features a **desktop sidebar** that transforms how you navigate through received emails on larger screens, providing a more intuitive and efficient browsing experience.

We've also implemented **automatic email refresh**, ensuring new messages appear immediately without manual page reloads. These improvements make AliasVault's email aliasing capabilities feel more responsive and integrated, bringing the experience closer to dedicated email clients while maintaining our privacy-first approach.

## üè† Self-Hosting Improvements

It's now easier than ever to install AliasVault on your own server. The `install.sh` script now includes **automatic dependency checks** that proactively identify potential issues before they impact your installation. This enhancement reduces setup friction and troubleshooting time for new deployments.

We've also improved our official installation documentation with better instructions and detailed troubleshooting guidance. These improvements make self-hosting AliasVault more accessible and reliable than ever.

In order to install AliasVault on your own servers, follow the [Server Installation](https://docs.aliasvault.net/installation/install) instructions.

## üîß Behind-the-Scenes

While not immediately visible to users, this release includes **major foundational work** on how vault creation and upgrade mechanisms function across all platforms. We've refactored the core vault logic into a shared library that all clients can now use.

This architectural work is preparation for upcoming changes to the vault data model that will enable **more flexible credential types**, **additional fields**, and **enhanced customization options**. By completing this foundational rework now, we can ensure that future vault structure updates will be seamless and older clients will be able to properly detect changes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Platform Improvements

This release brings additional enhancements across all AliasVault platforms:

- **Admin Panel**: Enhanced with more statistics and improved filtering options, giving administrators deeper insights into deployment usage and performance
- **Identity Generator**: New gender setting provides more control over alias generation, allowing you to specify preferences for newly created identities
- **Browser Extension**: Added popout buttons for improved navigation and streamlined user interactions
- **Mobile Apps**: Identity generator settings are now fully editable within the mobile applications

## üì¶ Migration Support

For users looking to migrate from other password managers, we've added **LastPass credential importing** and a **generic CSV importer** with template files. These tools make transitioning to AliasVault straightforward, whether you're coming from a specific password manager or a custom system.

## üêû Notable Fixes

- Resolved browser extension login confirmation screen issue when using autofill popups
- Fixed margin display problems on Android settings pages
- Disabled autocorrect on iOS autofill search fields for more accurate credential searching

## üõ£Ô∏è What's Coming Next

The architectural work completed in this release allows us to make significant vault enhancements in upcoming versions. Expect expanded credential types, additional field options, and more customization capabilities.

We're also continuing to refine the **email experience**, **cross-platform consistency**, and **self-hosting capabilities** as we progress toward v1.0.
