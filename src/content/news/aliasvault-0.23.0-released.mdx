## üê≥ 1. All-in-One Docker Image Now Officially Available

By popular request, AliasVault now provides an **all-in-one Docker image** that makes self-hosting significantly easier. This new image is perfect for:

- **Simple Docker/Docker Compose setups**
- **NAS devices** like QNAP or Synology
- **Quick testing and development** environments

The all-in-one image includes all necessary components in a single container, making it much more accessible for users who want to run AliasVault without managing multiple Docker containers. Updated installation and migration instructions are now available in our [documentation](https://docs.aliasvault.net/installation).

## üè¢ 2. Project Migration to New GitHub Organization

AliasVault has officially moved to a dedicated GitHub organization! The project is now hosted at [`aliasvault/aliasvault`](https://github.com/aliasvault/aliasvault) instead of the previous [`lanedirt/aliasvault`](https://github.com/lanedirt/aliasvault) location.

### Important for Self-Hosted Users:
