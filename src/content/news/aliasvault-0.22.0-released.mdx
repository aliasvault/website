## üåç 1. Expanded Multilanguage Support

AliasVault is now officially **available in six languages** across all platforms. In addition to English and Dutch, we're excited to welcome:

- **German** (Deutsch)
- **Finnish** (Suomi)
- **Italian** (Italiano)
- **Simplified Chinese** (ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá)

This expansion is thanks to our amazing community contributors on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/aliasvault). The translations are available across the **web app**, **browser extension**, and **mobile apps**.

## üîí 2. Enhanced Security Protections

### Clickjacking Mitigations
We've implemented additional **clickjacking protections** in the browser extension to address recent security vulnerabilities affecting password managers. While AliasVault wasn't specifically targeted, we take security seriously and have added measures to detect new attack vectors and prevent autofill in suspicious situations.

### Automatic Clipboard Clearing
**Automatic clipboard clearing** is now built into all platforms after copying sensitive values:
- **Mobile apps** (Android & iOS)
- **Browser extension**
- **Web app**

On Android, the mobile app also detects battery management restrictions to improve clipboard clearing reliability.

## üê≥ 3. Improved Self-Hosting Experience

### All-in-One Docker Image
By popular request, AliasVault is now available as an **optional single all-in-one Docker image** for easier NAS and self-hosting setups. While this version is experimental, all data remains fully compatible between the standard multi-docker setup and the new all-in-one image.

Self-hosted users can switch freely between the two setups without data loss. Documentation and video tutorials for the all-in-one image will be available soon.

### Enhanced Admin Panel
The admin panel now includes:
- **Username change functionality** for administrators
- **Improved logging** with non-warning entries
- **Top users by credentials** statistics
- **Revised initialization flow** for the all-in-one image

## üõ†Ô∏è 4. Enhanced Usability Features

### Import/Export Improvements
- **Dropbox Passwords importer** added to credential import options
- **KeePass CSV import** now handles special characters correctly

### Browser Extension Enhancements
- **Auto-lock timeout options** similar to mobile apps
- **Email domain chooser** for easier alias domain selection
- **Improved autofill detection** with shadow DOM support
- **Settings subpages** for better organization

### Mobile App Improvements
- **Email domain selector** for better alias management
- **Enhanced autofill** on iOS
- **Better error messages** for self-hosted users

## üîß 5. Technical Improvements

### Client Enhancements
- **Service URL validation** removed to allow any value for more flexibility

### Admin Panel Updates
- **Improved logging** and monitoring capabilities
- **Enhanced user management** features
- **Updated UI styling** for consistency

## üõ£Ô∏è 6. What's Coming Next
