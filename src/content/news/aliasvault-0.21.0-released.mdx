## üåç 1. Full Multilanguage Support

AliasVault is now officially **available in English and Dutch** across the **web app**, **browser extension**, and **mobile apps**. Language selection is automatic based on your system settings, or can be set manually in the app preferences.

Translations are managed through [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/), and we invite the community to help expand support to more languages including German, French, and Spanish and more.

## üîë 2. Advanced Password Generator

Creating strong credentials is now easier and more flexible. The **advanced password generator** is now available in the **browser extension** and **mobile apps**, giving you control over:

- Password length
- Use of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoiding ambiguous characters

You can now generate passwords that suit your security needs right at the moment of credential creation.

## üìé 3. Attachments and Previews

Attachments can now be **uploaded and downloaded** directly in the browser extension and mobile apps.

Mobile users can now **preview images and text files** directly inside the vault, without needing to download or store anything unencrypted on their device. This improves both usability and security when working on the go.

## üõ†Ô∏è 4. Self-Hosting Improvements

We continue to refine the self-hosting experience. The install script now detects **OS architecture issues**, ensuring 64-bit compatibility before proceeding. We also fixed false-positive warnings in the logs to improve troubleshooting clarity.

Whether you're deploying AliasVault for a team or personal use, installation is now smoother and more informative.
Follow our [Server Installation Guide](https://docs.aliasvault.net/installation/install) for details.

## üîç 5. Smarter Search and UX Tweaks

Other UI enhancements include:

- **‚ÄúLoad more‚Äù button** for recent email blocks
- **New statistics** in the Admin Panel, including storage usage and activity
- **Vault reset option** to clear all data in the web app's import/export settings

## üß± 6. Under-the-Hood Enhancements
