              You have full control over your data and can delete your account at any time through the official AliasVault hosted client at app.aliasvault.net. Upon account deletion, all associated data, including stored emails, will be permanently removed from our servers. Any email aliases you have created will be anonymized and orphaned, which means they will no longer work and no one else will be able to use them in the future. If you prefer to have your data removed by our team, you can submit a deletion request via email to our support team.
