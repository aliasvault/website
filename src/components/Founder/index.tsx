                As a software developer and architect, I&apos;ve always believed in fighting against spam and making privacy accessible to everyone. This led me to create asdasd.nl in 2013, a Dutch temporary email service that later evolved into SpamOK.com in 2023, helping thousands of people every day to protect themselves from unwanted spam and data collection through free temporary email addresses.
              </p>
              <p>
                To take privacy protection even further, I decided to create AliasVault â€“ a state-of-the-art encrypted password & alias manager platform that helps you reclaim control of your digital identity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The core of AliasVault is open-source and self-hostable, ensuring anyone can inspect the code and run it on their own infrastructure. In the future, additional premium features will be available through subscriptions to support the project and aid in further development.
