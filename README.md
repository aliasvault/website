Welcome to the AliasVault landing page repository. This project contains the source code for the website deployed at [https://aliasvault.net](https://aliasvault.net).

AliasVault is an open-source password and (email) alias manager built with C# ASP.NET technology. It can be self-hosted on your own server with Docker, providing a secure and private solution for managing your online identities and passwords.

### Key Features of AliasVault:
- **Zero-knowledge architecture**: All data is end-to-end encrypted on the client and stored in encrypted state on the server.
- **Built-in email server**: Generate virtual email addresses for each identity.
- **Virtual identities**: Create separate identities for different websites, enhancing security and privacy.
- **Open-source**: Available on GitHub and can be self-hosted.
